            Hi, I'm Pei-Chun Chang. I’m an AI Engineer at Novatek Microelectronics Corp., where I focus on real-time speech separation and audio machine learning for edge devices. 
            I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at National Chiao Tung University (now NYCU) in 2024.
            My work bridges academic research and practical AI applications, with a focus on audio and speech processing, digital image/signal processing, music information retrieval, machine learning, and deep learning.
            I continue to engage in academic research, applying my knowledge to build efficient, deployable AI systems.
            Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new AI techniques and developing projects that combine research with real-world impact.
